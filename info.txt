1 â€“ What is a Decorator? https://progressivecoder.com/how-to-create-a-nestjs-custom-decorator/
Decorators are quite common in many programming languages. However, they are relatively new in the world of Javascript.

A decorator is an expression that returns a function. It can take a target, name and property descriptor as arguments. We apply a decorator with an @ character and place it at the top of what we are trying to decorate.

We can define decorators for class, method or a property.
